Oric Atmos V1.1 ROM Sedoric Disk only.

HIRESMAN is a bunch of tools one can use on any hires screen.
It allows an area to be selected then an operation may be
applied to that area.

Once booted the Files menu will be displayed. From here you
may load a hires screen (Text screens are not supported)(2),
list the current disk directory(3), save the existing one(5),
view the keys used in the editor(7), Change the Device(8) or
Drive number (9), quit to main menu (0) or go to the HIRES
screen (Esc).

HIRESMAN Editor
Once in the Editor with the HIRES screen displayed you will
notice a single white inverse byte in the top left corner.
This is the selection Cursor. Move it aroun d with the cursor
keys, expand and contract the selected size with ZX and '/

Once you have set the area you want to modify then press the
key combination to do the operation and it will be done.
The selected area can be from 1 byte to the full 40x200 screen
size.

The following operations may be performed (note these are shown
in the Files option 7 key list)...

>>>> Byte Scroll Left (Func W)
Scrolls the area to the left in byte (6 pixel) steps but with
no wraparound.

Note key W stands for West

>>>> Byte Scroll Right (Func E)
Scrolls the area to the right in byte (6 pixel) steps but with
no wraparound.

Note key E stands for East

>>>> Byte Scroll Down (Func S)
Scrolls the area down but with no wraparound.

Note key S stands for South

>>>> Byte Scroll Up (Func N)
Scrolls the area up but with no wraparound.

If an attribute byte is present it will not be scrolled.
Inversed bytes will remain inversed.

>>>> Bit Scroll Right (Func R)
Scrolls the area to the Right in single pixel steps but with no
wraparound.
If an attribute byte is present it will not be scrolled.

>>>> Dump to Printer (Ctrl D)

This function is designed to work with Emulators only.

Please follow on-screen instructions. The printer must
be enabled/switched on before proceeding. Failure to
do so will cause a fatal crash in the software and a
reboot will be neccesary.

Once the printer has been switched on the program will
dump the selected area to the printer.
It will generate .byt statements followed by a number
of hex bytes. The number depends on the selected width.
If the selected width is less than 17 it will take the
selected width as the number of bytes per row otherwise
it will default to 16 bytes per row.
The output will begin with "SelectedArea00"

Example...

SelectedArea00
 .byt $43,$70,$40
 .byt $4F,$7C,$40
 .byt $49,$64,$40
 .byt $55,$6A,$40
 .byt $51,$62,$40

>>>> Wipe Area (Ctrl W)
Wipes the selected area. This is similar to Ctrl X but
does not affect the copy buffer.

>>>> Cut Area (Ctrl X)

the selected area on screen.

The copy buffer is the size of the HIRES screen.

>>>> Copy Area (Ctrl C)
Copies the selected area into the Copy buffer.

>>>> Paste Area (Ctrl V)
Pastes the copy buffer to the screen.
The selected area will be ignored. Only the top left

Replaces all attributes within the selected area with
an empty bitmap (64).

>>>> Remove Inverse (Func I)
Removes all inverse from the selected area.

>>>> Invert Area (Func V)
